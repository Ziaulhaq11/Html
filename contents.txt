//its like a home page of web browsera
Two types of tags : 

1.Single tag     -- it dont need a closing tag like <!DOCTYPE Html>
2.Container tags -- it means there will be two tags one for  opening and another for closing and these are like containers holding other tags or contents

Head tag  -- we define the title and description in this tag we can import other files also its like a settings

Attributes / Properties  -- inside the tags like name inside meta

Header,main and footer tags and article,section tags are very useful for seo purpose also. We can do the same thing without using them
as well but these will improve our webrating
