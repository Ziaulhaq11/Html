//its like a home page of web browsera
Two types of tags : 

1.Single tag     -- it dont need a closing tag like <!DOCTYPE Html>
2.Container tags -- it means there will be two tags one for  opening and another for closing and these are like containers holding other tags or contents

Head tag  -- we define the title and description in this tag we can import other files also its like a settings

Attributes / Properties  -- inside the tags like name inside meta

Header,main and footer tags and article,section tags are very useful for seo purpose also. We can do the same thing without using them
as well but these will improve our webrating

Two elements in Html
1.Block   (takes the entire width of the page for example you cant put something else on the page but you can in inline)
2.Inline  (takes just the space of what it need)
span are inline containers
divs are block  containers
